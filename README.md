# AES_Efficient_Pair_Search

This repository contains the source code used in the paper **"Efficient Pair Search Techniques for Zero Difference-Based AES Cryptanalysis"**. It provides implementations of various experimental methods for efficient pair searching in AES differential cryptanalysis.

## Overview

Several differential cryptanalysis techniques on AES require the search for ciphertext or plaintext pairs that exhibit **zero difference** in certain byte positions. Existing approaches include hash table-based methods and sorting-based methods.

However, when the number of candidate byte values to be checked exceeds the number of available plaintexts, traditional hash-based techniques become impractical. This work addresses this limitation and makes the following contributions:

- **Experimental validation** that hash-based and sort-based methods have similar performance when applicable.
- **A novel hash-based technique** that remains effective even when the number of candidate values exceeds the number of plaintexts.
- Utilizes custom hash function design, chaining, and memory pool techniques to improve performance.

### Key Findings

- Achieves comparable performance to merge sort.
- Approximately **1.3× slower** than quicksort.
- Approximately **5.3× faster** than implementations using C++ STL's `unordered_map`.
